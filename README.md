# Wireless-Communicaton-Education-Kit-Based-on-YTPC-SDR
This document is a wireless communication fundamentals training course manual prepared by YTTEK Technology, comprising a total of eight chapters.
It provides a comprehensive overview ranging from the basic principles of digital communications to various digital modulation and demodulation techniques, including 2ASK, 2FSK, 2PSK, QPSK, and 4ASK.
Each chapter outlines the experiment objectives, required equipment, and core principles, along with programming approaches and experimental procedures.
The course is designed to integrate theory with hands-on practice, enabling learners to master key concepts in wireless communication systems such as modulation, demodulation, filtering, and synchronization, with practical validation performed on an SDR platform.

**About**

Welcome to our Wireless Communication Fundamentals: An Education Kit Based on YTTEK YTPC SDR!

Our flagship offering to universities worldwide is the Arm University Program Education Kit series.

These self-contained educational materials are offered exclusively and at no cost to academics and teaching staff worldwide. They’re designed to support your day-to-day teaching on core electronic engineering and communication subjects. You have the freedom to choose which modules to teach – you can use all the modules in the Education Kit or only those that are most appropriate to your teaching outcomes.

Wireless Communication Fundamentals: A Practical Approach Education Kit covers the fundamentals of Wireless Communication System design, including how the theories and concepts can be applied in the design of a wireless communication and in the implementation of a basic modulation/demodulation module. A full description of the education kit can be found here.

**Kit specification:**

A full set of 8 modules with lecture slides and lab exercises (in selected modules) ready for use in a typical 10-12-week undergraduate course (full syllabus below).
Lab manuals include additional libraries for lab exercises and solutions for faculty.
Prerequisites: Students are required to have an understanding of Communication Theory and the basics of Matlab language.

**Course Aim**

To produce students with solid introductory knowledge on Wireless Communication concepts and application of these concepts in simulation, verification, and physical implementation of basic modulation/demodulation modules using standard industry tools.

**Tools Used**

Maltab.
Python
C++
